# Problem Solved:
**Predictive Inventory** : By analyzing historical data and external factors, the system accurately forecasts future demand, preventing stockouts and overstocking.<br>
**Optimized Reordering**: Intelligent agents autonomously trigger reorders based on predefined thresholds and demand predictions, streamlining the replenishment process.<br>
**Efficient Resource Allocation**: Agents optimize the allocation of resources like warehouse space and transportation, maximizing utilization and reducing costs.<br>
**Real-time Decision Making**: Agents respond dynamically to changes in demand, supply, and market conditions, enabling agile decision-making.<br>
**Enhanced Supply Chain Visibility**: The system provides real-time insights into inventory levels, order status, and delivery timelines, improving supply chain visibility and collaboration.<br>
By empowering intelligent agents to make informed decisions, this project aims to significantly improve inventory management practices and drive business growth.
